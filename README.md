## General
The fifth project in Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree focuses on [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). It's a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 


## Why this Project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## Test Expectations
1. The first three tests ensures the name and URL of the various feeds are defined
2. The next two tests check to make sure the menu is hidden by default and it opens/closes when clicked
3. The next test ensures the feed loads
4. The final test ensures the content is updates once it is loaded
